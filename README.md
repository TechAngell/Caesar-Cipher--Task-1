## Overview 

## Caesar Cipher (Encryption/Decryption)
This is a python program that is use to encrypt and decrypt a text using the Caesar Cipher by allowing users to input text and shift value for the encryption and decryption.

## features
1. Encrypt messages with a Caesar cipher.
2. Decrypt messages encrypted with a Caesar cipher.
3. User-friendly input for message/text and shift value.
   
## Step-by-step instructions on using the program:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install any required libraries (if applicable).
3. Run the program using Python (e.g., python caesar_cipher.py).
4. The program will prompt you to choose between encryption and decryption mode ('e' or 'd').
5. Enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt.
6. Enter the shift value for the cipher.
7. The program will display the encrypted/decrypted message.
   
## Example:
Enter 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e
Enter your message: This is a secret message.
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Wklv lv d uhfrph wkhqvh
